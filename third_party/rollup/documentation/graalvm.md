# GraalVM
GraalVM Community Edition is a Project that adds B8G like features to the Java Ecosystem using the JVM
it even offers a v8 replacement lib that binds the internals to the JVM.

If you work with a lot of exsiting Java code this is ideal to incremental switch it if a total rewrite
is not possible in time. 

You can incremental apply es4x to your javastack and move code incremental over to ECMAScript. 
Or you use the opfs.zip java module it is also based on vertx and is a fork of es4x using the opfs.zip
.webar filesystem.
