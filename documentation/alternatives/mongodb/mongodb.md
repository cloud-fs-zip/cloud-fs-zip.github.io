# Mongo DB
unlike mongo db cloud-fs.zip does not need anything to work with json 
as it is it self written in a json based superset so it has extended
features over mongodb as also a much higher performance and the ability
to sync directly with the client or even run on the client. 

also cloud-fs.zip is designed for big data out of the box with infinity scale
and fast responses in mind.
