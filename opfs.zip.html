# opfs-zip
Is a Framework / Format / Data Structure it implements the .webar 
Designed to implement stealify based applications compiled with the B8G Engine.
The B8G Engine is a Compiler build on top of the V8 Engine implements compiler feedback interfaces
and additional compiler tooling shipping with the  opfs.zip modules for v8 the v8 opfs.zip modules
can be used indipendent or as wasm or compiled with B8G, This again allows maximal Compatability
and code reuse. 

indipendent means c++ and optional ASM any other language integration needs to
export c binary compatiable modules as ASM or clib or compile as sayed before to wasm. Rust can do both. 
While we would highly recommendet point out that rust or crablang how its open fork is called is not usefull
you get memory safty already out of the box for any Language as the B8G Engine Containerises the memory for you.
And it also adds correct bound checking. 

It implements a so called stub method and bundels it with the files to directly deploy run and watch them
based on predefined rules in the stub method that can be conditional based on Environment.

This allows maximal Compatability between runtimes and Context Implementations.
As always the stub method can be replaced by any injected one for debugging needs.

The adviced file format for data shipping is tar containing .gz of raw stubmethod, data arrays delimereted by line
most best that tar file contains a integrity.txt see: markdown.html#!url=documentation/integirty.md 

the format is named usal .webar and represents a ECMAScript Archive which uses WInterOp Standards as default
compatible Environment.

as rule of thumb for c++ use uniq pointrs and cpp20+ if possible use always the safe abstractions over the unsafe.
