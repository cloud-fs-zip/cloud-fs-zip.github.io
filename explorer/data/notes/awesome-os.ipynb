That exist with other formats.\n\nStealify Lang is based on markdown and allows you to run markdown code cells. like\n\n\n```js\nexport const myName = Object.assign(element,{innerText='hi',});\n```\n\nStealify got designed with markdown first principels as today developers tend to loockup constant documentation and need to be able to get information fast \nthe good about the formart is also that it is highly export able to any other formarts in a 1*many relation this enables us to focus on the code and documentation at the same time\n\n## Example Serialized Application assets\n```js\nexport myAssetRef = {mime: '', content: ''};\n```\nas this is not designed to get send as urlString via HTTP we should use Uint8Array to represent binary content\nif we would plan for retriving this as query parameter or anything none preprocessed that needs to pass multiple processors and get not modified\nwe would go for base64 encoded stringChars but in our case as we plan to process with ECMAScript \nwe will use UInt8Array to get the most best performance.\nNote while you can implement ttl for compat it is always most time more clever to invalidate assets based on reference lists\nthe garbage collector in VirtualMachines also does act like that because it is clever.\n\nbelow some basic declarativ examples of JS / ECMAScript code that show you how to interact with elements based on\nsimple instructions.",

You do not need to write a single type and all gets resolved\nvia so called Type Inference this is a high +++\n\nif we need to return a type:\n```\nconst IMyType = {}\n// JSDOC Syntax\n// @type {} Typescript syntax.\n```\n\n## cpp c++ template functions\nThey allow you to pass in a object that may or may not have values and you can react based on the object\nthis allows you to use for example a v8 engine context inside your own c++ code as the bespoken object\nthat you template on.\n\nso you can add script engines to your code in a easy way and not add your code into a particular script engine.\nIt is always better to inhire the script engine programatical and extend it via composition as always.\n\na big part of AwesomeOS is the refactoring of the Chromium Project into v8 buildIn Modules\ncomposed out of ASM Pointers we archive that via above bespoken cpp template functions.\n\nthis way the module code is total indipendent from the engine while it can be highly performant dynamical linked into a engine instance \nwith zero boot overhead.\n\nProject deno for example is bad because it wrapps the whole v8 api not only the context. so it is tight coupled which is not usefull.\nProject mozilla goes Rust only with its engine\n\nThe biggest difference is in compilation. SpiderMonkey compiles JavaScript to an intermediate language which is interpreted. V8 differs by compiling JavaScript to machine instructions, eliminating a need for an interpreter. During compilation and recompilation, they perform many optimizations.\n\nand v8 compiles to ASM so you can interact on the ASM Pointer Level. It also has a IDL Lang called Torque to code additions if needed while modules always prefered\nbut for language feature implementation torque is a game changer.\n\n\n\n## How to use Stealify Lang?\nStealify Lang is a pattern to use ECMAScript Template Literals to check strings it allows you to incremental stream parse code\nand use compiler feedback to iterate overit this gets used internal by the Stealify Compiler which is closed source\nIt is a AI Driven Experiment out of the early 2000 created by Frank Lemanschik to prove the concepts of codeModification\nbased on readable instruction sets. \n\nThat leaded to a good base model to train AI's on to do code modification that makes real sense and not that none sense that ChatGPT 4\nAims for we apply deep understand of Language Implementation it self into the Model. It uses then internal baysian and other optimisation\nalgos to tune the application code to its final state this can be seen as multipass evolution of code over time.\n\nThe Stealify Lang Framework extends that pattern with common strategies to apply that pattern to your everyday code directly\nwithout using our AI Model wich internal does exactly that it annotates your code over time via incremental Stealify Lang Modules.\n\nas we can faster iterate over your code as you could ever write it we are able to incremental get the big picture while still\nbeeing blazing fast in run once and forget scenarios. This is the result of Years of Database and Distributed systems sync and scale knowleg\nlike deep understanding coherence concepts and locking. beeing on both sides of the Fences System Environment Implementer (RISC-V, WASM+WASI,JVM) / Language Implementer JS / PHP / HTML / CSS / JAVA / KOTLIN / JVM Langs\n\n```js\n\nconst MyLangRule = (strings,...propertys) => Array(strings.length).map(((string,index)=>`${string}${propertys[index].outerHTML || propertys[index]||''}`)).join('');\nconst html = MyLangRule; // enables html`` based on string\n// TODO is pseudo code but i got a lib that is well written named tagHTML some where.\nconst HTMLAsElement = (strings,...propertys) => Array(strings.length).map(((string,index)=> [DOMParser().parseFromString(string)].map(el=>el.appendChild(propertys[index]));\nHTMLAsElement`<h1>${document.querySelector('titel')}</h1>` // => HTMLElement<h1>[HTMLElement<title>]\nconst html = HTMLAsElements; // enables html`` based on DOMElements\n// checking something declarativ\n// use existing logic as function and then check strings and propertys. \n// This allows later on highly complex streaming language processing including revocation of a chain of manipulations and running\n// additional branches. Thanks to Stream inhrent Locking and error propergation this can all be expressed in a single line.\n// in entry points it is highly prefered to use obj.notation = '' to manipulate objects or Object.assign.\n```\n\n\n## Claim about classes\nthey are usefull in some situations if you need to design static interfaces for software like a browser but in most software they are bad\nanyway if you want to declare some classes its Better to use ECMAScript to do so that means\n\n```js\nfunction constructorFunction() {}\nconstructorFunction.prototype.property = ''\nconstructorFunction.prototype.propertyOther(){}\nconst indipendentBranch = Object.assign(constructorFunction.prototype, {propertyOther(){}});\nconst indipendentBranch2 = Object.assign(constructorFunction.prototype, {propertyOther(){}});\n\nconst fork = Object.assign(function forkConstructor(){},{ prototype: constructorFunction.prototype }, {propertyOther(){}});\n// I AM A big fan of this method as it shows that this is a class how ever the above is usefull to integrate with existing code\nconst forkClass = Object.assign(class {},{ prototype: constructorFunction.prototype }, {propertyOther(){}});\nconst indipendentForkBranch = Object.assign(fork.prototype, {propertyOther(){}});\nconst indipendentForkBranch2 = Object.assign(fork.prototype, {propertyOther(){}});\n\nreturn Object.assign(,fork);\n\n// turning the above into a regular class as adapter for eg: htmlElements\nclass extends HTMLElement {\n constructor() { Object.assign(this,fork); };\n}\n```\n\nwhy the above is importent? it leads to serialized function calls as serializeAble interaction with the code\nthat is importent for AI which is text based in general to more easy simple interact with the software as also you your self\nthe devtools protocol is a well designed interface and example.\n\nstatic and private propertys of a class while static properts are simple propertys on the function or class \nprivate propertys are something that does not realy exist they most best get implemented via a outer scope if needed\n\n```js\nconst scopeWithPrivates =  (...args) {\n    const definedPrivate = ''\n    // note that a class could ectends (expression) to dynamical create classes like mixins if needed.\n    // avoid all that but you should know how to do it.\n    return new class {};\n}\n```\n\n\n",
